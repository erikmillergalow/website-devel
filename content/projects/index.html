      <div class="col-sm-8"> The word Ikigai is used to indicate the source of value 
            in one's life and can be represented visually by a four-way venn diagram 
            in which the regions represent what you love, what you think the world 
            needs, what you are good at, and what you can be paid for. This daily 
            notes app will consist of reflecting upon your day and placing a pin
            on the diagram representing how you feel you have spent your time along 
            with a space for journaling. Will show trends such as average region and
            average movement over time.

      <div class="col-sm-8"> A web-app that will allow people to join sessions
            in which they can utilize various intuitive software instruments to 
            make music in real-time. Each instrument will be driven on a loop and
            the notes and sounds will be manipulated via a MIDI grid and easy to use
            yet powerful front-ends for synthesizers, samplers, and drum machines.
            Will support recording sessions and saving specific session setups.

      <div class="col-sm-8"> Top-down fast-paced multiplayer shooter inspired by 
            Geometry Wars. Simple gameplay, move with AWSD or the left joystick 
            and shoot by clicking or pointing the right joystick in a direction.
            Will support massive amounts of customization similar to the fine
            grained control that the player has over the parameters of each game 
            in Super Smash Brothers.
